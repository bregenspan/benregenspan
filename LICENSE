I want to keep this portfolio site design unique to this site, which is the only reason I am not releasing this whole site under MIT license, but please ask if you'd like me to split out and MIT-license any components of it.

Also note the presence of some third-party elements under their own licenses:
 * Icon font via Fontello (http://fontello.com/)
 * Source animation for unicorn GIF used in various places across the site (see (http://ben.regenspan.com/404). This unicorn GIF has been floating around the internet for some time, I just tweaked the color scheme. If you know the author, please let me know.
